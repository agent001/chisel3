/** Recursive Function Namer overview
  *
  * Summary:
  *
  * In every function, creates a NamingContext object, which associates all vals with a string name
  * suffix, for example:
  *   val myValName = SomeStatement()
  * produces the entry in items:
  *   {ref of SomeStatement(), "myValName"}
  *
  * This is achieved with a macro transforming:
  *   val myValName = SomeStatement()
  * statements into a naming call:
  *   val myValName = context.name(SomeStatement(), "myValName")
  *
  * The context is created from a global dynamic context stack at the beginning of each function.
  * At the end of each function call, the completed context is added to its parent context and
  * associated with the return value (whose name at an enclosing function call will form the prefix
  * for all named objects).
  *
  * During each context.name(obj, obj_name) call, Namer will check the context's descendants list
  * for an entry (desc_obj, desc_ctx) where desc_obj is reference-equal to obj. If there is one, it
  * will append obj_name as a prefix to all of desc_ctx's items, then add those items to its own.
  *
  * At a top-level (Module-level) Namer call, objects will be named directly, instead of being
  * added to a list of items (because there is no more prefixing that is dependent on an enclosing
  * scope).
  *
  * For functions, returns are wrapped in a function that:
  * - pops the current function's entry from the global dynamic context stack; this is
  *   assert-checked to catch edge cases where the stack might have been mismanaged
  * - adds the returned object as a descendant of the enclosing context; this allows the enclosing
  *   function to attach the name of the returned object as a prefix
